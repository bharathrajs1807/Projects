How temporal works:
    The Temporal Server tracks the progress of your Workflow function execution.
    The Temporal Server doesn't run your code.
    Your Worker, Workflow, and Activity run on your infrastructure, along with the rest of your applications.
    Run a Worker. A Worker is a wrapper around your compiled Workflow and Activity code.
    A Worker's only job is to execute the Activity and Workflow functions and communicate the results back to the Temporal Server.
